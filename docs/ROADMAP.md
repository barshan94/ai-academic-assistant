# Development Roadmap

Percentages are cumulative scope estimates, not proof of release readiness.

| Milestone | Scope | Cumulative target |
|---|---|---:|
| M1 | Foundation: scaffold, Supabase, auth, schema/RLS, CI and baseline tests | 10% |
| M2 | Document intelligence: Drive OAuth, PDF/image archive, OCR extraction, correction and teacher review | 25% |
| M3 | AI solver: structured exam answers, bilingual explanations, provider adapters, saved versions | 45% |
| M4 | Verification: deterministic checks, independent teacher review and correction workflows | 58% |
| M5 | Syllabus intelligence: board/qualification/subject/chapter/topic mapping | 68% |
| M6 | Chapter intelligence: cumulative notes, formulas, summaries and provenance | 82% |
| M7 | Exam preparation: topic gaps, question sets, exports and revision workflows | 93% |
| M8 | Production readiness: security, recovery, observability, performance and release | 100% |

## M1 exit criteria
- Application installs and starts locally.
- Supabase environment configuration is documented.
- Authentication and protected routes are implemented.
- Database migrations are mirrored in the repository.
- RLS and least-privilege grants are inspected.
- Lint, typecheck, build and automated tests pass.

## M2 status
Implemented in code: Google Drive OAuth flow, encrypted refresh-token storage, PDF archiving, image-to-PDF conversion, OCR extraction, page-level correction, explicit source review and manual source-linked question capture. Still required: real Google OAuth/Drive end-to-end testing, durable background processing, resumable large uploads and cross-account isolation tests.

## M3 status — in progress
Implemented on feature/m3-ai-solver:
- Structured exam answer schema and bilingual explanations.
- OpenAI-compatible server-side provider adapter with bounded input/output and HTTPS enforcement.
- Subject/qualification/board/chapter context passed into prompts; missing syllabus context is not guessed.
- Saved answer versions and safe schema validation.
- Arithmetic, supported chemistry atom-count and physics dimensional checks.
- Owner review history and question-scoped teacher invitations/review history.

M3 exit criteria still outstanding:
- Configure a provider key/model securely and test live generation with explicit cost approval.
- Build a golden question set across subjects and manually grade output quality.
- Add citation/source-grounding and mark-scheme comparison workflows.
- Test teacher invitation, acceptance, review and revocation using two real accounts.
- Add automated database authorization tests for cross-account isolation.

## M4 exit criteria
- Unsupported verification is explicitly marked not checked.
- Independent teacher feedback is tied to authenticated reviewer identity.
- Corrections are retained as append-only events and never silently overwrite AI drafts.
- Teacher verification status is only set through an independently authorized workflow.
- Golden-set results are reviewed before release.

## Working rules
- Complete acceptance criteria before calling a milestone done.
- Preserve working features; use separate branches for risky changes.
- Run tests after each meaningful change and report exact outcomes.
- Never claim an AI answer is verified unless the relevant check actually ran.
- Keep main and production untouched until explicit merge/release approval.
